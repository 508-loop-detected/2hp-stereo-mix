2HP Stereo Mixer

<img src="2hp-stereo-mix.jpg" width=180>

A simple stereo mixer -- it has 1 plain-mono input, a second mono input that becomes a hard-panned left-channel when the third input, a dedicated right channel, is patched into. No pan pots, sorry, it's 2HP. I actually designed it to go with a combination 4-way low-pass gate and stereo panning mixer that I haven't gotten around to uploading here yet.
